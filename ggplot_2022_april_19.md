    Liz Hare - Thank you for the invitation. I am not going to be working on this project. I’d like to say a little about why.
I appreciate and respect Jonathan’s work on BrailleR. I feel that RStudio should be putting more resources into this project and into accessibility in general. The IDE still  isn’t accessible and there are issues with training materials and documentation of RStudio packages. I have had negative interactions with an RStudio leader regarding accessibility and inclusion. There has been very little interaction with blind users as experts in accessibility.

I work on a contract basis without a secure salary or benefits. I’m happy to volunteer for projects along with other volunteers, but RStudio is a for-profit company with paid employees.

I’m still looking forward to other opportunities to work with FORWARDS on DEI and accessibility.

    
    Gary Ritchie from RStudio via email "I don't have any background in ggplot or stats in general, so probably not going to be able to contribute much in this particular project based on what I heard at the meeting". We thank him for coming.

Possibility of working with UW group

* geom_smooth() - would a straight line been good enough to describe the line, does a straight line remain within the confidence interval or how many times does it go outside, what is the variation of the gradient with respect to the average of the gradient.
* How monotonoic is a relationship?
