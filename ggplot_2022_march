# Accessibility & ggplot 2022-03-22

## Attendance

Present: gwynn, Liz, gary ritchie, Kelli Johnson, Jonathan
Apologies: 

Introductions:

Goals and ideas:
    Add words to geom_*() when library(brailleR) is loaded
    
    Add +theme_access()  that does something like ggpattern package
    
    Notes from slackathon in Feb 2022:
    If brailleR is loaded, then VI.ggplot will be doing actions on ggplot object that is printed/plotted.
brailleR::VI.ggplot() will look for breadcrumbs, create any that don't exist and ultimately aggregate the full set of breadcrumbs.Each layer of any ggplot would need to be handled so that a common breadcrumb identifier is generated.
What would a consist extra item look like? Should it be a text string?
We think yes!
How do we augment the ggplot object layer by layer...

Need to know:
    How to describe the shape of a curve produced by geom_smooth() when it's a curve
Describe the axis, range of axises, metadata
A way to push the fig.cap to fig.alt - 
Add a verbose = TRUE to include all information and verbose = FALSE to have less information regarding x and y labels and such. 
It is not accessible if it just reads axises. 
BrailleR - should students be given answers to questions through the package? Is the question accessible?

What kinds of questions do experienced blind users ask?
Goes up then down, how long does it go up, how steeply, level for awhile go 
Monotonic, big picture turning points, geom_smooth() had 17 turning points - wobbling around but pretty flat - default settings are not doing what we want - monotonically 
Count number of inflection points to see if it wobbles too much
If you cannot explain the figure contextually in a few words then you probably should not be using the figure.

A range of how would you describe this graph?

Depends on the audience, Liz and Jonathan want something different then a first year uni student
Beginner, intermediate, and advanced

Not factual - girl with red dress in Schindler's list - movie was in black and white

geom_theme() for ggplot had grey background and white grid lines

twitter - most important parts come out b/c of constraint - unconstrainted has lots of words but not helpful,

June - tidyTuesday - accesibility coming in June. 

Before and after tidyTuesday to see the differences

***Actions:
    Jonathan - reduce verbosity, and level of compression, factual/subjective - for brailleR / experience

gwynn - comprehensive list of ggplot2 - twitter - LinkedIn - crowdsource - research crowdsourcing 
Kelli - Alison Horst - graphic to engage
Gary - talk JJ and Hadley

Next meeting - 4 weeks today
