Goals and ideas:
    
    Comments on grant from Kelli:
        "Is the goal to provide alt-text for a figure or code to produce the alt-text? I honestly cannot remember and the proposal doesn't make it clear who will write the code."
        
        Our project will help us start to understand what we need to automagically create alt-text.
        
        
        "Comments on "The Problem" I don't think that accessibility has become more important because it has always been important. So, I would delete the first sentence and move the second sentence to the end of what is now the second paragraph.The sentence that starts with "Eventually" is long and incomplete. I would change "curve plot, but" to "curve plot. But, ". Then the end of this sentence needs something, I think that there should be a comma after "science" like "are insufficient to produce useable results." "ggplot" is actually "ggplot2"
I think that the last paragraph should be more in depth about the problem of alt-text in ggplot2 and expand on the first sentence of this paragraph rather than give a solution."

    "I am not sure what is meant by "open innovation" but if I am just out of touch please ignore this comment."


    thousands use RMarkdown and need accessible plots to meet accessibility requirements mandated by world wide web cons


    Automated text is much better than training thousands of people to write alternate text. Although repeating the caption was a good start, but we can better as some do not write meaningful captions.


Comments on grant from Jonathan:

    "Broad appeal and works for BLV people. This will improve accessible plots for not only BLV people but also for all organizations that must produce accessible documents. 


    RMarkdown does not comply with WCAG graphics and many organizations are being forced to change their workflow 


    We want to avoid people turning away from RMarkdown because WCAG guidelines are not currently met.
