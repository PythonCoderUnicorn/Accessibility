# Website Accessibility

Accessibility is to ensure a positive user experience (UX) for people without and with disabilities such as sight, hearing, and speech, neurological conditions and low internet quality [(HostingCanada)](https://hostingcanada.org/canadian-website-accessibility-guidelines/). 

[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/REC-WCAG21-20180605/) is broad ranging recommendations to make the internet more accessible. There are two streams of recommendations, one for persons with disabilities and the other is regarding accessibility of web content, such as devices used. 


**Guidelines** - The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities.


**Success Criteria** In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: 
- A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). 
- Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in [Understanding Levels of Conformance.](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels)

#  Accessibility Data Visualization

This information is from **Sylvia Canel√≥n and Liz Hare** 2021 Conference slides [link](https://github.com/spcanelon/csvConf2021)

- science communication
- election maps
- ebooks alt-text
- R pkg documentation
- R blogs

screen readers read text not images

good alt-text:

- description of the data
- variables included on the axes
- scale described within the description
- type of plot described


FORMULA for alt-text for images (Nightingale, 2020)

## alt = `"chart_type"` + `"type of data"`  + `"reason for including chart"`  + `"link to data source"`
